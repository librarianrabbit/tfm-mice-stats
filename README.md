A tool for gathering online stats for players of the game Transformice!.

## Disclaimer
This is an old private project for viewing online stats for players of the game Transformice.

Transformice is a game developed by the company [Atelier 801](http://transformice.com/about-us/index.php). I have no affiliation with their company nor with any of their projects.

This project is available here in the hope it can be useful but is simply distributed as is, wihtout warrant of any kind, under the MIT license.

## Notes
This is an old project and might require code changes to be compiled on newer Qt versions.
